# lib/upgrade/oclfix.sh — post-startup OCL concept-name fix.
#
# Run ONCE, AFTER the v1 instance has fully started and finished its OCL import
# (~30+ min after start). During that import OCL voids the local concept names
# (reason "Removed from OCL") and inserts its own replacements. This:
#   1. Unvoids the original names and voids OCL's replacements in the 'openmrs'
#      db (openmrsdb service).
#   2. Renames CIEL_*.zip -> .DONE in the OCL dir of the EMR (openmrs) service
#      so the import does not run again on the next startup.
# Naturally idempotent: a second run finds nothing to unvoid and no zip to move.
# Depends on: logging, prompt (confirm), as_root() (privilege).
# Uses config: RESTORE_DIR, DOCKER_COMPOSE, DB_SERVICE, EMR_SERVICE, DB_NAME,
#              DB_USER, DB_PASS, OCL_DIR.
